hands on pc maintenance
On 30 October 2025, I did hands-on PC Maintenance learning by attaching and reattaching PC compartments.

Through this activity, I learned how to properly open the system unit, identify internal components and understand 
the function of each part inside a PC. This session helped me gain a clearer understanding of how hardware components 
work together and the importance of handling them correctly.

This practical experience strengthened my technical knowledge and gave me more confidence in understanding PC systems beyond theory.
