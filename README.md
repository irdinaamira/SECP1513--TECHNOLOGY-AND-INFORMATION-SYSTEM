## PC Assemble
- **Summary**: I did hands-on PC Maintenance learning by attaching and reattaching PC compartments.
- **What I learned**: Through this activity, I learned how to properly open the system unit, identify internal components 
                  and understand the function of each part inside a PC. This session helped me gain a clearer understanding 
                  of how hardware components work together and the importance of handling them correctly.

- **Reflection**: This practical experience strengthened my technical knowledge and gave me more
              confidence in understanding PC systems beyond theory.
