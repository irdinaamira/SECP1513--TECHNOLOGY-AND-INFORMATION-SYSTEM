# PC ASSEMBLE
Date: 30 october 2025

place: software innovation lab

# SUMMARY
I did hands-on PC Maintenance learning by attaching and reattaching PC compartments.

# WHAT I LEARNED
Through this activity, I learned how to properly open the system unit, identify internal components 
and understand the function of each part inside a PC. This session helped me gain a clearer understanding 
of how hardware components work together and the importance of handling them correctly.

# REFLECTION
This practical experience strengthened my technical knowledge and gave me more confidence in understanding PC systems beyond theory.
